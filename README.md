# LeanGames

The purpose of this repo is to show how to play the games from [Lean Game Server](https://adam.math.hhu.de) locally on your computer instead of remotely through the browser. The demonstration will highlight the differences between the code accepted by the Lean Game Server and the code that works locally in Lean 4.
